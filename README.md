# ENEE408G-Facial-Recognition-Working
Hey Guys, here is the general readme for the project. I will add a few notes (that I got from reading the starting guide that can be found here (https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) If you want to look through it. 
1) In the "Code" tab you should be able to see a create new file if you want to add your code. This will create a new Master branch for that file
2) If you want to edit someone else’s code you can do that via a new branch off of the master. I don’t know if you have permission to do this but you can comment directly to whatever master branch you are working on or create a new branch in you edits. 
3) Pull request are how you ask the rest of us to adapt your changes to our branches of the code. We can accept them to incorporate the differences
